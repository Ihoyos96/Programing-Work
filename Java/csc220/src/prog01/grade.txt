Go to drive.google.com.
Double-click on workspace.
Double-click on csc220.
Double-click on src.
Double-click on prog01.

On top, you should see (EXACTLY -- CASE SENSITIVE)

My Drive > workspace > csc220 > src > prog01

1. If it is Workspace or something else, rename or move it.

2. If it is CSC220 or something else, create the csc220 project in
   Eclipse, move your prog01 and prog02 into it, share src with
   csc220@cs.miami.edu.

Once you have the right directory names, run the Visual Debugger on
prog01.  Single step and step into methods.

In Google Drive, you should see an images directory in prog01.
